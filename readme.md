# Heart*-ex*

A python program to read heart rate data from a COM port (from [pulse sensor](http://pulsesensor.myshopify.com/) via an Arduino microcontroller.)

It provides a simple user interface based on [matplotlib]() and then saves the raw and computed data into an excel spreadsheet.

Also attached is a modified version of the code to run on the Arduino. With the modified code the LED is switched on when you press the button on the Arduino.
This way, you can keep it connected all the time and only turn the LED on for measurements.
